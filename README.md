# first-project
Project - "V-Control" Designed and engineered an IOT based model for automation of valve operation using Arduino UNO .Task of filling water into beakers till the set height and simultaneously allowing the water from first beaker to flow into the second beaker by filling it to another set height. Height is achieved by operating the solenoid valves using Arduino Uno. Ultra Sonic Sensors are used to determine the depth of water for accurate output of water level in tank. The accuracy of height is shown in serial moniter. Briefly,the project involves designing , automation and controlling the flow of water using solenoid valves and Ultra Sonic sensors for the level measurement and Arduino for system control and extended the model to communicate through mobile adapting IoT technology using blue tooth module.
